# Education, Internship Experience, and Classs Titles 
I am a senior at the University of Denver studying Business Information Analytics with Minors in Spanish and Journalism. Throughout my Analytics studies, I have taken classes on Automating Business Process, Foundation of Information Management, Data Mining and Visualization, Enterprise Information Management, Dara warehouse, and Business Intelligence, and Project Management and Simulation. The remaining courses I have to take are Complex Data Analytics and Optimization Modeling. Out of all the courses I have taken thus far I most enjoyed my Visualizations class which focused on Tableau. I have developed my experience using Tableau through not only my course work but with my internship as a Data Analyst with Capstone Partners. While at the investment banking firm, Capstone Partners, I lead a project on creating visualization for the marketing team to optimize communication engagment. I used data gathered through Hubspot and extensively analyzed the data to see which days and times emails were sent had the highest open rate, which departments had the highest open rate, and which mailing lists had the most engagement with the communication they were sent. I worked closely with my mentor and presented my finding to the head of strategic operations and the head of marketing. Both were very pleased with my work and gain new insights into the way in which people engage with the communication they receive .
